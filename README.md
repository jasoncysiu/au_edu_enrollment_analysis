# Australia’s Education Sector Met with a Sledgehammer: 2025 Enrolment Crisis Looms

## Overview

Australia’s international education sector, once a vibrant pillar of growth and cultural exchange, is facing an unprecedented crisis. Recent shifts in visa regulations and global economic and geopolitical uncertainties have severely impacted enrolment figures. This project delves into historical trends and provides a modelled forecast to highlight the severe decline expected in enrolments for 2025, shedding light on the challenges facing Australia's educational institutions.

This project analyzes the dramatic impact of recent policy changes on Australia's international education sector. By examining historical enrolment data and projecting future trends, the project aims to:

- **Evaluate the Impact of Policy Changes:** Assess how new visa regulations and stricter immigration policies have affected enrolment figures across various educational sectors.
- **Identify Trends and Declines:** Analyze historical data to identify patterns and forecast future enrolment trends, particularly focusing on the anticipated decline in 2025.
- **Provide Insights for Stakeholders:** Offer actionable insights for policymakers, educational institutions, and stakeholders to understand and address the forthcoming challenges in the international education sector.

## Data Source
The data for this project is sourced from the **International Student Monthly Summary** and accompanying data tables provided by the Australian Department of Education. This dataset offers up-to-date information on international students studying on a student visa in Australia. It includes monthly summaries as well as year-to-date (YTD) and full-year data, offering insights into enrolments, commencements, and student numbers by month, year, education sector, source country, and state/territory. For instance, the YTD data for May 2024 shows 810,960 enrolments, reflecting a 17% increase from 2019, and highlights record commencements of 289,230. Data is extracted from the Provider Registration and International Student Management System (PRISMS), which provides live updates to ensure the accuracy of reported figures. The detailed monthly and annual reports available [here](https://www.education.gov.au/international-education-data-and-research/international-student-monthly-summary-and-data-tables) are essential for understanding current trends and forecasting future enrolment patterns.
